CloudTrail increments the minor version if a change adds new fields to the event structure.

Applications can ignore new fields to stay compatible with new minor versions of the event structure.\nIf CloudTrail introduces new event types, but the structure of the event is otherwise unchanged, the event version does not change.\nTo be sure that your applications can parse the event structure, we recommend that you perform an equal-to comparison on the major version number.

Sessions are created when any API is called that returns temporary credentials. Sessions are also created when users work in the console and when users make a request with APIs that include multi-factor authentication. Attributes for this element are:\ncreationDate – The date and time when the temporary security credentials were issued. Represented in ISO 8601 basic notation.\nmfaAuthenticated – The value is true if the root user or IAM user whose credentials were used for the request also was authenticated with an MFA device; otherwise, false.\nsourceIdentity – See AWS STS Source Identity in this topic. The sourceIdentity field occurs in events when users assume an IAM role to perform an action. sourceIdentity identifies the original user identity making the request, whether that user's identity is an IAM user, an IAM role, a user authenticated by using SAML-based federation, or a user authenticated by using OpenID Connect (OIDC)-compliant web identity federation. For more information about how to configure AWS STS to collect source identity information, see Monitor and control actions taken with assumed roles in the IAM User Guide.\nOptional: True",

For example, if the temporary security credentials were obtained by assuming a role, this element provides information about the assumed role. If the credentials were obtained with root or IAM user credentials to call AWS STS GetFederationToken, the element provides information about the root account or IAM user. Attributes for this element are:\ntype – The source of the temporary security credentials, such as Root, IAMUser, or Role.\nuserName – The friendly name of the user or role that issued the session. The value that appears depends on the sessionIssuer identity type. The following table shows the relationship between sessionIssuer type and userName: (See table in CloudTrail userIdentity element - AWS CloudTrail )\nprincipalId – The internal ID of the entity that was used to get credentials.\narn – The ARN of the source (account, IAM user, or role) that was used to get temporary security credentials.\naccountId – The account that owns the entity that was used to get credentials.\nOptional: True",
