This includes removing a JSON field that already exists, or changing how the contents of a field are represented (for example, a date format). CloudTrail increments the minor version if a change adds new fields to the event structure. This can occur if new information is available for some or all existing events, or if new information is available only for new event types. Applications can ignore new fields to stay compatible with new minor versions of the event structure.\nIf CloudTrail introduces new event types, but the structure of the event is otherwise unchanged, the event version does not change.\nTo be sure that your applications can parse the event structure, we recommend that you perform an equal-to comparison on the major version number.
